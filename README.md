Step-by-Step Tutorial on Using Git, WebStorm, and GitHub

<h1>Introduction</h1>

This tutorial will guide you through setting up Git and GitHub using WebStorm and GitHub to manage your code efficiently. By the end of this tutorial, you will have a solid understanding of how to work with version control using Git and GitHub.

<h3>Part 1: Directions on Using WebStorm with Git and GitHub</h3>
<ul>
<li>Step 1: Install Git
Download and install Git from the official site: https://git-scm.com/.
Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.
</li>
<br>
<li>Step 2: Install WebStorm
Download and install WebStorm from JetBrains: https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/download/.
Follow the setup process and ensure Git is correctly set up by navigating to File > Settings > Version Control > Git and verifying the path to Git.
</li>
<br>
<li>Step 3: Create a GitHub Account
Visit https://github.com/ and sign up for an account if you don't already have one.
</li>
<br>
<li>Step 4: Create a New GitHub Repository
Go to your GitHub dashboard.
Click on New Repository.
Name the repository A02.
Add a description if desired.
Select Public or Private based on your preference.
Check Add a README file.
Click Create Repository.
The URL of your repository should be https://github.com/yourUCID/A02.
</li>
<br>
<li>Step 5: Clone the Repository in WebStorm
In WebStorm, go to VCS > Get from Version Control.
Enter the repository URL: https://github.com/yourUCID/A02.
Select the directory where you want to clone the repository.
Click Clone.
</li>
<br>
<li>Step 6: Make Changes to the README.md
Open the README.md file in WebStorm.
Add the content for your tutorial and glossary.
Save the changes.
</li>
<br>
<li>Step 7: Commit and Push Changes
Go to Git > Commit.
Write a commit message such as Task: Add README content.
Click Commit.
Once committed, go to Git > Push to push your changes to GitHub.
</li>
<br>
<li>Step 8: Submit the Repository Link
After pushing your changes, submit the repository URL (e.g., https://github.com/yourUCID/A02) to Canvas.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Part 2: Glossary</h3>
<ul>
**Branch**: A branch in Git represents an independent line of development. It allows you to develop features separately from the main codebase.

**Clone**: Cloning a repository means making a copy of the GitHub repository on your local machine.

**Commit**: A commit in Git is like saving your work. It takes a snapshot of your code and stores it in the repository.

**Fetch**: Fetching updates the local copy of the repository with the latest changes from the remote, but it does not merge them.

**GIT**: Git is a distributed version control system that helps you track changes in your codebase and collaborate with others.

**GitHub**: GitHub is a platform that hosts Git repositories online, providing a user interface for version control collaboration and management.

**Merge**: Merging combines changes from different branches into a single branch.

**Merge Conflict**: A merge conflict occurs when Git cannot automatically resolve differences in code between two branches.

**Push**: Pushing sends your committed changes to a remote repository like GitHub.

**Pull**: Pulling fetches the latest changes from a remote repository and merges them into your current branch.

**Remote**: A remote is a version of your project that is hosted on a server, typically on GitHub, allowing others to collaborate.

**Repository**: A repository is a project container in Git that tracks all changes and contains all files related to the project.
